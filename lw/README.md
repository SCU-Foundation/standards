# Lattice Web (LW) v1.0

**Status:** Draft Standard  
**Version:** v1.0  
**Steward:** SCU Foundation  
**Research Body:** Lattice Research Institute (LRI)

The Lattice Web Standard (LW) defines the **semantic graph substrate** of the Lattice ecosystem.  
It governs graph‑level semantic structures, metadata schemas, node and edge classes, graph envelopes, provenance, identity anchoring, and cross‑domain semantic coherence.

LW v1.0 establishes the constitutional rules for how semantic content is structured, represented, and interconnected across agents, domains, and systems.
