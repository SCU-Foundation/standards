# Lattice Meta (LM) v1.0

**Status:** Draft Standard  
**Version:** v1.0  
**Steward:** SCU Foundation  
**Research Body:** Lattice Research Institute (LRI)

The Lattice Meta Standard (LM) defines the meta‑semantic layer of the Lattice ecosystem.  
It governs contextual meaning, semantic alignment, cross‑domain coherence, and the constitutional rules that determine how meaning is extended, constrained, and harmonised across agents, domains, and semantic structures.

LM v1.0 establishes the formal meta‑semantic substrate that all Lattice‑conformant systems MUST respect.
