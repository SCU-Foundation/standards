# Lattice Identity Token (LIT) v1.0

**Status:** Draft Standard  
**Version:** v1.0  
**Steward:** SCU Foundation  
**Research Body:** Lattice Research Institute (LRI)

The Lattice Identity Token (LIT) defines the constitutional identity substrate of the Lattice ecosystem.  
It governs identity primitives, identity binding, provenance, attestation, identity boundaries, and identity revocation.

LIT v1.0 establishes the formal rules for how identity is represented, verified, constrained, and attested across all Lattice‑conformant systems.
