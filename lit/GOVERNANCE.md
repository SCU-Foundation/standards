**Version:** v1.0  
**Steward:** SCU Foundation  
**Research Body:** Lattice Research Institute (LRI)  
**Repository:** REPO: Standards — /lit/

## Purpose

This document defines the governance model for this standard, architecture unit, or repository.  
All governance authority flows from the SCU Foundation, the neutral, non‑commercial steward of the SCU ecosystem.

This governance model is identical across all SCU repositories.

---

## Governance Authority

The SCU Foundation is responsible for:

- maintaining canonical specifications and architecture  
- ensuring long‑term neutrality and stability  
- enforcing trust, safety, and identity‑boundary rules  
- approving or rejecting changes  
- maintaining the canonical repository structure  
- ensuring alignment with Repo‑Map vE1.2 and GRM vE1.1  

The Lattice Research Institute (LRI):

- conducts identity and attestation research  
- supports interpretability and standards‑adjacent work  
- provides non‑binding research input to governance  

---

## Decision‑Making

All decisions follow the SCU Foundation’s governance‑root documents:

- REPO: Governance — /governance-charter.md  
- REPO: Governance — /change-management-charter.md  
- REPO: Governance — /safety-governance.md  

These documents define:

- decision authority  
- voting or approval processes  
- safety and identity‑boundary enforcement  
- change‑management sequences  

---

## Change‑Management

All changes MUST follow the governed update sequence:

1. proposal submission  
2. governance review  
3. safety and identity‑boundary evaluation  
4. structural and canonical alignment check  
5. approval or rejection  
6. versioning and documentation updates (if applicable)  
7. merge according to governed sequencing  

No changes may bypass this process.

## Prohibited Governance Actions

The following are not permitted:

- redefining governance authority  
- bypassing change‑management processes  
- introducing proprietary or commercial influence  
- altering safety, trust, or identity‑boundary rules  
- modifying canonical repository structure without approval
