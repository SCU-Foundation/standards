## Purpose

This document defines the contribution rules for all standards, architecture units, and repositories within the SCU ecosystem.  
All contributions MUST follow the SCU Foundation’s governance, safety, and change‑management processes.

These rules are universal across the ecosystem.

## Contribution Principles

Contributors MUST:

- follow the SCU Foundation’s governance and change‑management rules  
- maintain neutrality and avoid proprietary or commercial influence  
- ensure all contributions align with canonical repository structure  
- respect semantic boundaries and safety principles  
- provide clear, evidence‑based proposals  
- avoid ambiguity, drift, or undocumented changes  
- follow update sequences defined in governance‑root documents  

---

## Contribution Process

All contributions MUST follow this process:

1. **Proposal Preparation**  
   - clearly describe the change, rationale, and expected impact  
   - ensure alignment with Repo‑Map vE1.2 and GRM vE1.1  
   - confirm the change does not violate trust, safety, or semantic‑boundary rules

2. **Submission**  
   - submit via pull request or governance‑approved channel  
   - include references to relevant governance‑root documents  
   - ensure all files follow canonical formatting and repo‑scoped referencing

3. **Review**  
   - reviews are conducted by the SCU Foundation and, where relevant, LRI  
   - reviewers assess correctness, neutrality, safety, and structural alignment  
   - additional clarification may be requested

4. **Approval or Rejection**  
   - the SCU Foundation makes final decisions  
   - approved changes are merged according to governed update sequences  
   - rejected changes include rationale and guidance for revision

The following MUST NOT be submitted:

- proprietary, product‑specific, or commercial content  
- ambiguous or incomplete proposals  
- changes that bypass governance or update sequences
