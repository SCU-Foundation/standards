# Lattice Protocol (LP) v1.0

**Status:** Draft Standard  
**Version:** v1.0  
**Steward:** SCU Foundation  
**Research Body:** Lattice Research Institute (LRI)

The Lattice Protocol (LP) defines the **semantic substrate** of the Lattice ecosystem.  
It establishes the constitutional rules governing semantic primitives, semantic boundaries, semantic validity, semantic envelopes, identity‑anchored semantics, and cross‑domain semantic interoperability.

LP v1.0 is the foundational semantic standard that all Lattice‑conformant systems MUST respect.
