These rules are universal across the ecosystem.

## Contribution Principles

Contributors MUST:

- follow the SCU Foundation’s governance and change‑management rules  
- maintain neutrality and avoid proprietary or commercial influence  
- ensure all contributions align with canonical repository structure  
- respect semantic boundaries and safety principles  
- provide clear, evidence‑based proposals  
- avoid ambiguity, drift, or undocumented changes  
- follow update sequences defined in governance‑root documents

## Contribution Process

All contributions MUST follow this process:

1. **Proposal Preparation**  
   - Clearly describe the change, rationale, and expected impact.  
   - Ensure alignment with Repo‑Map vE1.2 and GRM vE1.1.  
   - Confirm the change does not violate trust, safety, or semantic‑boundary rules.

2. **Submission**  
   - Submit via pull request or governance‑approved channel.  
   - Include references to relevant governance‑root documents.  
   - Ensure all files follow canonical formatting and repo‑scoped referencing.

3. **Review**  
   - Reviews are conducted by the SCU Foundation and, where relevant, LRI.  
   - Reviewers assess correctness, neutrality, safety, and structural alignment.  
   - Additional clarification may be requested.

4. **Approval or Rejection**  
   - The SCU Foundation makes final decisions.  
   - Approved changes are merged according to governed update sequences.  
   - Rejected changes include rationale and guidance for revision.
