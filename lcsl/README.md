# Lattice Certification & Safety Layer (LCSL) v1.0

**Status:** Stable Standard  
**Version:** v1.0  
**Steward:** SCU Foundation  
**Research Body:** Lattice Research Institute (LRI)

The Lattice Certification & Safety Layer (LCSL) defines the constitutional safety substrate of the Lattice ecosystem.  
It governs certification, safety constraints, attestation requirements, provenance rules, domain transitions, capability boundaries, version floors, update sequencing, and operational compliance.

LCSL v1.0 establishes the formal rules that ensure all Lattice‑conformant systems operate safely, predictably, and within certified boundaries.
