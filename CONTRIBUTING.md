# Contributing to the SCU Foundation Standards Repository

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the SCU Foundation’s open standards ecosystem.

This repository contains canonical standards stewarded by the **SCU Foundation** and informed by research from the **Lattice Research Institute (LRI)**.  
All contributions must follow the governance, review, and change‑management processes defined below.

---

## Contribution Principles

- All contributions MUST preserve the neutrality, clarity, and non‑commercial nature of the standards.
- All changes MUST align with the SCU Foundation governance model.
- All proposals MUST be implementation‑agnostic and free of proprietary dependencies.
- All contributions MUST be submitted through GitHub Issues or Pull Requests.

---

## How to Contribute

### 1. Filing an Issue
Use GitHub Issues for:

- clarifications  
- errata  
- proposed improvements  
- questions about conformance  
- requests for additional examples (non‑normative)

Issues MUST:

- reference the relevant section(s) of the standard  
- clearly distinguish normative vs. non‑normative concerns  
- avoid implementation‑specific language  

---

### 2. Submitting a Proposal (Pull Request)

Pull Requests MUST:

- modify only the relevant standard folder  
- update `CHANGELOG.md` when appropriate  
- update `VERSION` only when approved by the SCU Foundation  
- include a clear rationale and references to governance rules  

PRs that introduce breaking changes or normative modifications will undergo extended review.

## Review Process

1. **Initial Review**  
   SCU Foundation maintainers verify structure, clarity, and governance alignment.

2. **Research Review (LRI)**  
   LRI evaluates semantic, interpretability, and standards‑adjacent implications.

3. **Governance Review**  
   SCU Foundation determines whether the change is normative, editorial, or deferred.

4. **Approval or Revision Request**  
   Approved changes are merged; others receive feedback.

## Normative Changes

Normative changes (those affecting requirements, conformance, or guarantees):

- MUST follow the SCU Foundation Change‑Management Process  
- MUST be documented in the Standards Registry  
- MUST increment the version number  

---

## Editorial Changes

Editorial changes (typos, formatting, clarifications):

- MAY be merged with lighter review  
- MUST NOT alter normative meaning  

---

## Code of Conduct

All contributors MUST follow the repository’s `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`.
