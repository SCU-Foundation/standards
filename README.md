# SCU Foundation — Open Standards

This repository provides the canonical index for all open standards stewarded by the SCU Foundation.  
It does not contain the standards themselves; each standard is published on its own canonical surface and versioned independently.

The Foundation is the neutral, non‑commercial steward of the SCU architecture and all Lattice standards.

## Stewarded Standards

### 1. SCU — Superconducting Compute Architecture  
Architectural definition (not a standard).  
https://scu.foundation/architecture/

### 2. Lattice Protocol (LP v1.0 — Final)  
Semantic, identity, and trust substrate of the AI‑native internet.  
https://latticeprotocol.org

### 3. Lattice Web (LW v1.0 — Final)  
AI‑native metadata standard for the semantic web.  
https://latticeweb.org

### 4. Lattice Meta (LM v1.0 — Final)  
Meta‑semantic layer for meaning stability and semantic contracts.  
https://latticeprotocol.org/meta/

### 5. Lattice Identity Token (LIT v1.0 — Final)  
Identity layer for semantic agents and AI‑native systems.  
https://scu.foundation/lit/

### 6. Trust Stack (TS v1.0‑draft — Draft Complete)  
Safety, trust, identity, memory, cognition, perception, and governance architecture.  
https://scu.foundation/trust-stack/

## Reference Implementations (Not Standards)

These are built by SCU Labs and are not governed by the Foundation:

- Lattice‑Native Browser  
- ORB OS  
- ORB Hardware  
- LifeLing Architecture  
- DMM (proprietary)

## Versioning & Governance

All standards follow:

- **Versioning Rules v1.2**  
- **Change Management Charter v1.1**  
- **Standards Registry v1.3**

Canonical governance documents are maintained in the `governance` repository.

## Purpose of This Repository

This repository serves as:

- a canonical index of all standards  
- a pointer to their official homes  
- a stable reference for developers, researchers, and implementers  
- a governance‑aligned overview of the standards ecosystem  

It does **not** contain:

- full specifications  
- drafts  
- research proposals  
- implementations
