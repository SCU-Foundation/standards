# SCU Foundation — Open Standards

This repository provides the canonical index of all open standards stewarded by the SCU Foundation.  
It does not contain the standards themselves; each standard is published on its own canonical surface and versioned independently.

The Foundation is the neutral, non‑commercial governance root responsible for stewardship, certification, and long‑term stability of the Lattice standards ecosystem.

The Lattice Research Institute (LRI) serves as the independent research body for semantic evolution, interpretability, and standards‑adjacent research.

## Stewarded Standards

### 1. SCU — Superconducting Compute Architecture  
Architectural definition (not a standard).  
https://scu.foundation/whitepaper/

### 2. Trust Stack (TS v1.0 — Final)  
Constitutional trust, identity, safety, provenance, and interoperability standard.  
https://latticeprotocol.org/standards/ts/

### 3. Lattice Protocol (LP — Draft)  
Semantic substrate for identity, trust, and meaning across the AI‑native internet.  
https://latticeprotocol.org/standards/lp/

### 4. Lattice Web (LW — Draft)  
Metadata layer enabling structured, machine‑interpretable meaning.  
https://latticeprotocol.org/standards/lw/

### 5. Lattice Meta (LM — Draft)  
Meta‑semantic layer governing contextual meaning and semantic alignment.  
https://latticeprotocol.org/standards/lm/

### 6. Lattice Identity Token (LIT — Draft)  
Identity‑binding and identity‑integrity layer for agents and systems.  
https://latticeprotocol.org/standards/lit/

## Reference Implementations (Not Standards)

Reference implementations MAY be built by third‑party developers.  
They are **not** governed by the SCU Foundation and MUST NOT be treated as standards.

Examples include:

- browsers  
- operating environments  
- hardware platforms  
- agent runtimes  
- developer tooling  

These implementations are outside the scope of this repository.

---

## Versioning & Governance

All standards follow:

- **Versioning Governance**  
- **Change Management**  
- **Standards Registry**  
- **Transparency Requirements**

Canonical governance documents are maintained in the `governance` repository.

The Lattice Research Institute (LRI) contributes semantic research and proposal development but does not govern standards.

## Purpose of This Repository

This repository serves as:

- a canonical index of all standards  
- a pointer to their official homes  
- a stable reference for developers, researchers, and implementers  
- a governance‑aligned overview of the standards ecosystem  

It does **not** contain:

- full specifications  
- drafts  
- research proposals  
- implementations
